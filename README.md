# A bunch of templates [![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)
I am working on Nix-ifying as much of my setup as possible, which includes dev templates. This repo is inspired by [Luc Perkins' dev-templates repo](https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates/tree/main). These are (so far) templates that are not included there that I have found useful in some of the dev tasks that I am working on in my personal time.

Please note that I do not consider myself an expert on Nix in any way, shape, or form. Use these at your own risk.
